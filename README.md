# Payloader

Payloader is a lightweight command and control (C2) framework designed to facilitate fast, automated delivery of payloads between an attacker (server) and a target (client). This framework eliminates the need for human intervention, enabling seamless emulation of C2 operations.

## Repository Structure

- **`client/`**  
    Contains scripts and tools for the target (client) side of the C2 server. These scripts handle the execution of payloads delivered by the server.

- **`server/`**  
    Contains scripts and tools for the attacker (server) side of the C2 server. These scripts manage payload generation, delivery, and communication with the client.

## Features

- Automated payload delivery and execution.
- Lightweight and modular design for easy customization.
- Supports rapid emulation of C2 operations.

## Usage

1. Set up the server by running the scripts in the `server/` directory.
2. Deploy the client scripts from the `client/` directory on the target system.
3. Configure the server to deliver the desired payloads to the client.
4. Monitor and manage the C2 operations through the server interface.
